"1) The Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and Leader of the Opposition are eligible for VIP Transport services. This transport service is invoiced to the Parliamentary Service at a rate of $171 per hour and disclosed at this rate. VIP Transport for Ministers is charged at $68 per hour and disclosed at that rate.  The variable rates reflect Parliamentary Service's lower usage level and a different charging regime. ",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
"2) The surface travel disclosure for Simon Bridges includes $3,065 relating to prior quarters. This is due to delayed billing from VIP Transport Services (DIA)",,,,,,,,
3) Jami-Lee Ross was a member of the National Party for the period of the disclosure so has been included in Nationals return. ,,,,,,,,
