=====
## What we did:
As part of Govhack 2019, we processed publicly available financial and pecuniary interest data about politicians from PDFs, and showed the outputs on a webapp.

The webapp was deployed on AWS for a while with:
- Route53 Handling DNS
- an EC2 instance hosting a Next.JS webapp
- An S3 bucket for storing all the political data

## Who we helped
We tried to help the average voter understand what their politicians were influenced by (ie: gifts, financial interests, etc)
and to give them a clearer picture of what they were voting for - 

## Todos:
- New Zealand MP Voting records ie: Did they vote for or against gay marriage? For or against the children anti-smacking law? Immigration? etc etc etc. This is difficult as you will need to parse a crapload of data from Hansard... We couldn't do it within a weekend :(
